                <p class="serif">If I had the chance I go for game development course where I can create my 
        own game. I've wanted to become a game developer since I played zelda the ocarina of time I
        just love the style its a complete original design.  </p>
        <p class="serif"> As of now I'm still only a student but I'm not willing to give up, but my 
            ambition is to one day have at least a secondary income come from games  </p>  
            <p class="serif"> Being a game developer is less like being a director on your 
                    very own movie and a lot more like being a construction worker… 
                    without a union. Job stability and opportunities for advancement are 
                    presently unusual, the environment is often high-pressure to the point of
                     making it difficult to have a life outside of work,
                     profits are a terrible uncertainty. I suspect it will only
                     get more difficult in the next few years.  </P>

                <p class="serif">One big mistake people make is not realizing that happiness is an individual choice. 
            But every choice is influenced by the people in our lives. 
            If you change your life influencers for the better, 
            you can dramatically increase your chances for happiness and success. </p>
