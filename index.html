<p> <span style="font-weight:bold">Personal Introduction</span></p>

<p class="serif">I want to share my experience as student on what 
    I have learnt and have gone through. 
    It makes me learn to be independent and exploring new things stepping out 
   of my comfort zone. Able to contribute some good deeds and continue helping out for society in the future.
    Hence, I had learnt to be more confident and independence in everything 
   that I do but also learn to rely on teamwork as an important factor to succeed. 
   It also makes me reflect every activity I did and the meaning behind every activity 
   that touch me. It helps me to build my character and my strength. 
   In the meantime, be sure to contact me if you're interested through phone or social media.
